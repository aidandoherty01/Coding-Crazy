## ðŸ‘´ Git Branch Naming Guide

I know you guys know how to use GitHub but this is just for consistency and it looks pretty.

### ðŸ’° Main Branches

- **`main`** â€“ The stable, production-ready branch.
- **`develop`** â€“ The active development branch where new features are merged before release.

### ðŸ”„ Workflow Example

1. Make sure you are in **develop**
2. Run `git pull` to get the latest changes before creating a branch
3. Create a new branch with one of the prefixes above
   > Example: `git checkout -b feat/adding-sprite-movement`
4. Add and commit your changes
   > `git add .` > `git commit -m "my changes"`
5. Push yo branch & changes

   > `git push origin feat/adding-sprite-movement`

   > or if you want to be make multiple pushes you can do
   > `git push origin -u feat/adding-sprite-movement`,
   > then after initially pushing the branch you can just do
   > `git push`

6. Submit a PR in GitHub
   1. Go to project repo
   2. Click pull requests
   3. Select `base: develop` and `compare: your-branch-name`
   4. Add a comment
   5. Fix merge conflicts if any
   6. Let another teammate review changes and they can merge them
7. Boom
